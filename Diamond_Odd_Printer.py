# Delera, Aritz B.

# 1. Diamond Shape:
# Write a Python function named print_diamond that takes an odd integer n as an argument and prints a diamond shape with a width of n using the * character.
# For n = 5, the output should be:
#    *
#   ***
#  *****
#   ***
#    *
# Note: If an even number is passed, the function should return "Please provide an odd integer."


# Make a DiamondPrinter class that we will be using for the program
# define the printing process
# use for loop for upper hand of the diamond
# use for loop for the middle row of the diamond
# use for loop for the lower half of the diamond
